# 302_VolJump
Repository for CS302 Vol Jump Project Group
Step 1: special libraries needed to build/compile if personal machine was used 

We worked on “Vol Jump” in the Unity library. You may need to use the Unity library to compile the program and it advised to just download unity.


Step 2: Instructions on how to build/compile our project:

 1) In order to run Vol Jump,
    Go into the "Executable_Game" Folder, and download the 
   "COSC-FINAL.exe" file. Double clicking this executable should get the game to work. 

2) If this does not work, and the game must be built on your local machine then you must have 
   Unity Version 2021.3.23f1 Installed. You must pull all files from the repo, then open Unity Hub.
   In the main screen, click "Open", then navigate to the Assets folder of the Vol_Jump Repo and open it.
   After this is done, go to file -> build and run. Create a folder for the executable to be built in and save.
   
Step 3: User Manual with how the controls/ interactions work.

The controls for the game are fairly simple:
  There are two simple buttons you have to know, the left and right arrow. 
  Left arrow moving the starship to the left. 
  Right arrow moving the starship to the right. 
  With interaction, there are two main interactions: The buttons and the power Ts’. While hitting the power Ts’, the player will jump. 
  For the buttons, you can left click them for optimizing your game by adjusting the volume and changing the background. 
  There are other buttons to interact with such as quit and play.

Step 4: Any known bugs/errors (if the bugs and errors are reported then they won’t grade hard)
  After compiling and running the game multiple times to see if there are any bugs. 
  High Score Screen Automatically Loads "1" instead of 0 sometimes when clicking around the main menu.
  Game does not keep the player from leaving the left and right bounds of the camera.
